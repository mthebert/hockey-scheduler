Hockey Scheduler

This is a full-stack JavaScript single-page app that was designed to solve a problem with scheduling hockey games for a men's league team.  This is being done as a side project when I have time.  It is far from complete.

Technologies:
	AngularJS 1.3.15
	NodeJS
	Hapi for the API as well as Boom and hapi-mongodb
	JQuery 1.11.3
	BootStrap 3.3.4
	MongoDB

Other tools used were npm, sublime text editor, git bash and github.com

Start - 5/26/2015

Functionality - just a skeleton now.  More documentation will follow

Revisions:  
5/26/2015 - started the app skeleton with the MEAN stack, dropping express for hapi.  Add bootstrap and jquery.
5/27/2015 - flushing out the angular skeleton, make the git repository
5/28/2015 - Themed out the bootstrap for initial design

to run - npm start
